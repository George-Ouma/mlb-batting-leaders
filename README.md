# MLB Batting Leaders
This project involves the use of BeautifulSoup, requests and pandas to extract data from the ESPN website. Some of the data that I collected from the website include the players' hits (H), Runs Scored (RS), Tripples (T), and Doubles (D), among others.
All that data, covering more than 7 pages and over 300 players, is then neatly presented in a pandas dataframe.
